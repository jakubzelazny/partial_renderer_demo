# README

Quick demo app to show a mistake in Rails Guides. It's supposed to prove the points.

Steps:
1. Create a new article.
2. Show the new article.
3. Change the partial "articles/\_article.html.erb" to see the error.
4. Fix the partial.
5. Go to /notes. See that the partial gets rendered from "articles/article", not from "notes/article"
